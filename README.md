### Concept Overview

Meta-Bot is an intelligent chatbot platform designed to create customized chatbots for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Our aim is to help businesses enhance their customer service experience without requiring extensive technical knowledge or resources.

### Use Case Example

Imagine a shoe shop owner named Sarah. Sarah wants to improve her online customer service without hiring additional staff. She uses the Meta-Bot platform to create a chatbot for her shop. Here’s how it works for Sarah:

1. **Input Phase**: Sarah uploads an Excel file containing her product catalog, including details like shoe sizes, colors, prices, and availability. She also provides basic information about her shop.
2. **Customization Phase**: The MetaBot asks Sarah about the shipping options, and common customer questions. Sarah answers these queries through the Excel sheet.
3. **Bot Creation**: The Meta-Bot generates a custom chatbot for Sarah’s shoe shop. The chatbot can now answer customer questions about product availability, help them find the right shoe size, inform them about ongoing promotions, and guide them through the purchase process.

## Challenge Addressed
